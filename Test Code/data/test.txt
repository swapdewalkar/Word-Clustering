The taxi-hailing app is considered both brilliant and controversial, depending on who you ask. Here we've documented the company's journey to a  70 billion valuation.  Disclaimer  it's been a bit of a bumpy one... uber X  Uber Uber board agrees to push ahead with SoftBank investment, and a 2019 IPO  Uber's board has manoeuvred to further limit the power of beleaguered former chief exec Travis Kalanick and decided to go ahead with proposed investment from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, plus an initial public offering  IPO  by the end of 2019.  Investor Benchmark   which had previously attempted to push Kalanick from the board  see below    said it would drop its lawsuit as long as the SoftBank deal goes ahead.  In a statement seen by Reuters the board agreed to bolster corporate governance within the company following a wave of scandals and lawsuits.  Uber said   The board voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by SoftBank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders.

It's believed that new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought in to lessen tensions at the director level and throughout the board, as well as reshape Uber's reputation. Transport for London agrees to further meetings with Uber  Khosrowshahi met with regulators from Transport for London this week. Reports suggest that while the talks didn't resolve the city's decision to strip the ride-sharing company of its licence, there could be some headway.  A TfL spokesperson describing the meeting as constructive   Today's constructive meeting centred on what needs to happen to ensure a thriving taxi and private hire market in London where everyone operates to the same high standards. Further steps in this process will take place over the coming weeks.   Uber CEO to meet with Transport for London this week  New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is set to meet Transport for London's transport commissioner Mike Brown on 3 October, after the ride-sharing app lost its licence to operate in the city.  Last week, London mayor Sadiq Khan said that TfL's doors will be open for discussion with Uber. A spokesperson for TfL said   Following an approach from Uber, and at the mayor's request, London's transport commissioner will meet with Uber's global CEO in London.   Khosrowshahi had previously apologised for  mistakes  that the company had made when it was announced Uber was to be stripped of its licence.  A spokesperson for Uber said that the new CEO is  looking forward  to meeting with the transport commissioner.  Khosrowshahi's appointment as CEO marks a shift in Uber's historically belligerent corporate approach, with the company currently awash with controversy over various sexism scandals, including a lawsuit. Uber will not be issued a new private hire license  Uber will not be issued a new private hire license, Transport for London has said in a statement today.  According to TFL, Uber is not fit to hold a private hire operator licence and will not be issued a new one after the expiry of its current one, as of 30 September 2017.  TFL claimed that the taxi-hailing firm's 'approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility' including its approach to criminal offences, medical certificates and its use of 'Greyball' - a piece of software that blocks regulators from accessing the full application and performing law enforcement duties.  Uber has 21 days to appeal this decision and can continue to operate in London until that process expires. Uber chooses Expedia boss Dara Khosrowshahi as new CEO  29 August 2017  The Uber board has made its pick for a new CEO, choosing the current Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi for the role. And while Khosrowshahi is yet to confirm that he has accepted the role, it is widely expected to happen this week.  Khosrowshahi will replace founder Travis Kalanick after he started an undefined leave of absence after a list of controversies, including a sexual harassment scandal.  With names like HP Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt being thrown around, the decision to appoint the Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi may have come as a bit of a surprise to some. FTC orders Uber privacy audit every two years for two decades  16 August 2017  America's Federal Trade Commission  FTC  has ruled Uber must face a privacy audit every two years for the next 20 years, partly as a response to the ride-sharing company's  God View  program, but also due to a 2014 data breach.  God View was an internal program that let employees monitor the locations of customers who had used the app to request a car. Later, the company's former forensic investigator claimed that Uber staff used the app to spy on politicians, celebrities, friends, and spouses. There was even talk from senior employees at Uber that the company tracked reporters.  The business claimed that access to the tool was limited and since those revelations has introduced a chief security officer along with a sizeable team of employees  dedicated to protecting user information .  The FTC ruling states that Uber will have to implement a privacy programme to address the complaints.  Each audit will have to explain the privacy controls that Uber implemented, as well as detail how these are appropriate to the size and complexity of the company. They will also require that the privacy controls  are operating with sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance to protect the privacy of personal information .  Security researcher Lee Munson said that with GDPR coming into effect next May, Uber could benefit from the ruling.   While such an agreement with the FTC may sound incredibly arduous, Uber will probably benefit from a necessary change in approach, which will stand it in good stead for the incoming GDPR,  he said. Uber introduces in-app tipping ahead of tribunal appeal  14 August 2017  Uber has announced a raft of new features for the ride-sharing service in the UK that it promises will provide drivers with  more control  and to  make the most of their time  on the app   but it has been dismissed by the lead claimant from last year's tribunal for improved working conditions as a 'cynical' move ahead of Uber's upcoming appeal in the courts.  The update includes in-app tipping and revisions to the cancellation policy, and it has also promised fairer ratings for drivers.  The company claims that the changes were prompted by a 12-month consultation with its drivers. In-app tipping will launch across the UK tomorrow and will also apply to UberEATS, Uber's equivalent to gig-economy takeout delivery service Deliveroo.  Uber's rating system   which has courted controversy for unfairly punishing drivers   has been tweaked so that issues that are not the fault of the driver, such as problems with the app, will no longer affect ratings.  Uber will also introduce paid waiting time for drivers   for every two minutes that the driver waits for a passenger, the passenger will pay 20p. This will come into effect on 22 August.  Passengers will now pay a cancellation fee if they cancel their trip within two minutes of having their driver confirmed rather than the previous five minutes.  Uber is also introducing a 'no thanks' button so drivers can immediately turn down a trip rather than having to wait for the request to time out, which is currently between 10 and 20 seconds. If trips are declined three times in a row, the app will mark them as unavailable. And UberXL or Exec drivers can now opt out of seeing UberX trips altogether.  The destination feature, which pairs drivers with passengers heading in the same direction drivers want to go, will be available six times a day rather than twice a day, and now includes an 'arrival time' feature so drivers can set the time they need to get to their destination.  But the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain  IWGB  has said that the new features are a 'cynical' ploy ahead of an upcoming appeal from Uber against a ruling that it will have to grant its drivers employment status.  The IWGB, with the support of the GMB general union last year, won a major tribunal ruling that would see Uber drivers treated as employed workers.  James Farrar, who chairs the United Private Hire Drivers section of the IWGB, said   This is a cynical PR move ahead of Uber's appeal next month against last year's employment tribunal ruling in favour of drivers.   Despite its claims, Uber remains completely deaf to the most serious issue facing drivers   excessively long hours earning on average between  5 and  6 per hour. If Uber was more concerned about driver welfare than it is with propping up its own dreadful reputation, it would have abided by the tribunal's decision and guaranteed drivers a minimum wage and holiday pay.   Instead, we are talking about 'innovations' such as a 'fairer' rating system and a 'no thanks' button. We say, thanks Uber but 'no thanks'.  Uber founder Travis Kalanick resigns  21 June 2017  After months of turmoil, Travis Kalanick has resigned after reported pressure from Uber's shareholders.   This news comes after a review of the firm's practices and a sting of scandals including sexual harassment claims.  And most recently, Kalanick said he was taking an indefinite leave of absence following his mother's death.  According to The New York Times, five major investors demanded Kalanick's resignation with immediate effect.   I love Uber more than anything in the world,  Kalanick reportedly said  And at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to take a leave of absence  15 June 2017  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has taken an indefinite leave of absence as the company contends with increased internal turmoil and staff losses. It is unclear who will lead the ride-hailing company at this stage. Kalanick is also dealing with personal issues following the sudden death of his mother in a boating accident which has left his father hospitalised. Listen  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick takes leave of absence amidst internal turmoil  The under-fire CEO has been under increasing pressure to step away from the company amidst a series of crises, mostly stemming from accusations of pervasive sexual harassment and other corporate misbehaviour since former engineer Susan Fowler published a damning blog post back in February.  Since then one quarter of Uber's traditional C-suite jobs have been vacated and many of Kalanick's closest advisors -- internally called the 'A-Team' -- have left the company.  The company has announced it will implement a set of sweeping changes to the organisation following the recommendations of an investigation by the former US attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. and his law firm, Covington   Burling.  However, at the all-hands meeting intended to run through these 13 recommendations, there was yet another example of the pervasive sexism at the company.  It is reported that during the meeting, board member Arianna Huffington talked about how having one female director typically leads to more female directors. Fellow board member and founding partner at the private equity firm TPG, David Bonderman apparently silenced the room by saying that adding more women to the board would result in  more talking.  He quickly apologised and resigned from his position on the board. Uber reportedly tracked Lyft drivers using a secret programme called 'Hell'  13 April 2017  Using a software programme called 'Hell', Uber has been secretly tracking Lyft drivers, The Information reports.  Uber used 'Hell' to create fake Lyft accounts which meant it could monitor how many drivers were available for new rides and what their location was.  This comes a few months after Uber staff were caught spying on celebrities and former partners using a tool called 'God's View', now called Heaven. Read more on this below. Italy bans Uber for unfair competition  10 April 2017  Uber has been ordered to stop all activities across the entirety of Italy, Reuters reports.  The ban comes after courts ruled that Uber represents unfair competition for taxi drivers, claiming that Uber doesn't respect transportation laws.  Uber has been granted 10 days to stop all its activities including any advertising and marketing campaigns. After that, the company must pay  10,000   8,533  per day if it continues to operate. Uber president Jeff Jones steps down   20 March 2016  After joining the company less than six months ago, Uber president Jeff Jones is stepping down, in a move that was  completely unexpected  by colleagues.  The BBC reports that Jones grew frustrated that a new COO was being appointed and he was not being considered for the position. However, according to Recode, Jones's departure is due to Uber's ongoing controversies surrounding sexism and sexual harassment.  In a statement on Sunday Uber said   We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best.   Read more here. Uber shuts down UberTAXI in London  13 March 2017  Uber announced last week that it's shutting down its UberTAXI service in London, as of the 31 March 2017.   Launched in 2014, UberTAXI lets Uber customers hail black cabs through its mobile app, rather than a normal Uber car.   Since we first launched UberTAXI, hundreds of black cab drivers have taken tens of thousands of trips through the Uber app. However, in recent months, those numbers have tailed off,  said Uber in a blog post published Friday afternoon.   At Uber we always want our riders to be able to get a car whenever they want and wherever they are   no matter which option on our app they choose. That hasn't been the case recently with UberTAXI, which is why we will be ending this option on 31 March,  it added.  In the statement, Uber said that it would be focusing on car-sharing options and even fully electric cars. Uber CEO apologises after being caught on video arguing with driver about fares  1 March 2017  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has apologised after a video obtained by Bloomberg showed him in a heated exchange with Uber driver Fawzi Kamel.  Kamel expressed his distress at the way Uber treats its drivers, even telling the CEO   I'm bankrupt because of you .   You're raising the standards, and you're dropping the prices,  said Kamel.  People are not trusting you anymore. I lost  97,000 because of you. I'm bankrupt because of you.  Kamel then added   You keep changing every day.   In response, Kalanick said   Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck   Then he proceeded to slam the car door. Google's self-driving firm Waymo is suing Uber  24 February 2017  Waymo is taking legal action against Otto, a self-driving vehicle company bought by Uber last year for  700m. Uber is being sued for stealing trade secrets and technology, according to the BBC.  The lawsuit alleges that Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo employee, took information from Waymo by 'downloading 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files' before moving on to cofound Otto.   Our parent company Alphabet has long worked with Uber in many areas, and we didn't make this decision lightly,  said Waymo in a blog post. Uber CEO steps down from Trump's advisory council  3 February 2017  Following heavy criticism of Uber's practices during recent anti-Trump protests, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has stepped down from Donald Trump's economic advisory council.  Kalanick said that his participation was 'misinterpreted' as an endorsement of Trump's agenda.   Earlier today I spoke briefly with the president about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community.   I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,  said Kalanick in an email to Uber employees obtained by the Guardian.  DeleteUber leads to more than 200,000 people to delete their Uber accounts  2 February 2017  After the protests against Trump's executive order banning refugees and nationals of seven Muslim countries last week, Uber was accused of trying to profit from the protest.  This has led to over 200,000 people deleting their Uber accounts following the  DeleteUber boycott, according to a report from The New York Times. Uber's self-driving cars pick up passengers in San Francisco  14 December 2016  Uber's self-driving cars will pick up passengers in the San Francisco area today.

All passengers need to do is request an uberX using the standard consumer-facing mobile app. Uber employees reportedly caught spying on celebrities and former partners  13 December 2016  According to reports, Uber employees have been spying on celebrities and former partners. Uber staff used its 'God's View' feature to monitor the movements of  high-profile politicians, celebrities and even personal acquaintances of Uber employees, including ex-boyfriends girlfriends, and ex-spouses , wrote Samuel Ward Spangenberg's, Uber's former forensic investigator. Earlier this year Spangenberg was fired from Uber over age discrimination.  Uber told Reveal in a statement   we have hundreds of security and privacy experts working around the clock to protect our data. This includes enforcing to authorised employees solely for purposes of their job responsibilities, and all potential violations are quickly and thoroughly investigated.  Uber also said that its  God View  tool no longer existed, instead opting for an internal tool called  Heaven View . Uber's self-driving truck Otto makes its first delivery  26 October 2016  Uber has joined forces with AB InBev to transport 50,000 bottles of Budweiser, in what is thought to be the world's first self-driving commercial delivery.   The truck transported the beer more than 120 miles with police vehicles in tow, with reports suggesting the truck driver was relaxing in the back sleeping cab.  Uber starts mapping UK city streets  16 September 2016  From today Uber will be collecting images of UK city streets, starting with London. According to the BBC, these images will be used to determine the best pick-up and drop-off points around the city with plans to expand mapping activities to Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham. This image data will most likely aid Uber's driverless cars ambitions. Uber to launches self-driving car pickups in Pittsburgh  14 September 2016  During an interview with Bloomberg last month, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick revealed that it will deploy around 100 'driverless cars' in Pittsburgh.   Each vehicle will be fitted with self-driving capabilities and be staffed by one engineer, designed to take control of the car if needed and a co-pilot to note its progress, with the addition of a computer to record trips and map their data.  This move comes after Uber acquired Otto, a startup aiming to deliver autonomy to lorries and trucks. Numerous reports have suggested Uber may use these capabilities in its own driverless car plan, or potentially its own driverless lorry business. Uber takes legal action over TfL's plan to force drivers to take written English test  18 August 2016  Uber is taking legal action against London's transport authority TFL over its plans to force Uber drivers to pass a written exam in English.   The legal battle centres on TFL's new rules for private hire drivers that require people from non-English speaking countries to take  and pass  a mandatory written English test costing  200.  In addition to this, Uber has taken issue with TfL's rule that drivers must be covered by commercial insurance during out-of-work hours. Uber celebrates four years of service in London   29 June 2016  Uber has been operating in London since 2012 when it launched 90 cars in the capital.

Uber and Lyft business model faces challenge over driver status  11 March 2015  The two companies want to classify their drivers as contractors rather than employees, which means they are not subject to employment protection law.  In separate cases, two federal judges said the status of the companies' drivers will need to be decided by juries. If the drivers are considered employees, they could be entitled to minimum wages and any tips that customers pay, as well as other benefits. In that sense, the case is seen as a legal test that could affect other companies in the  sharing economy.   Read more here.
