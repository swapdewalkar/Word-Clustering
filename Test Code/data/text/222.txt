CONTENT:It was a little over a year ago that the Heartbleed bug shocked the Internet with its potential for mischief. Now another flaw in open source code has sent network administrators into damage control mode.The bug, called "Venom" for "Virtualized Environment Neglected Operations Manipulation," allows an intruder to jump out of a virtual machine and execute malicious code on its host. Virtual machines are widely used in data centers, so it has the potential to cause widespread mischief."Exploitation of the Venom vulnerability can expose access to corporate intellectual property, in addition to sensitive and personally identifiable information, potentially impacting the thousands of organizations and millions of end users that rely on affected [virtual machines] for the allocation of shared computing resources, as well as connectivity, storage, security and privacy," reads a post on the CrowdStrike website. Venom was discovered by Jason Geffner, CrowdStrike senior security researcher.Although the bug will make many system administrators shudder, it is not only easier to fix than Heartbleed, but also more difficult to exploit.Moreover, major virtual machine product makers VMWare and Microsoft have said their offerings are not affected by the bug. Amazon, which uses virtual machines as a staple of its cloud infrastructure, also has said that its systems are unaffected.Because an organization could have thousands of virtual machines in its data center, attackers trying to exploit Venom easily could find themselves in a virtual jungle."If you broke out of a VM, you wouldn't know what server you'd end up on unless you had a sophisticated penetration team," said Jared DeMott, a principal security researcher at Bromium."You'd need some good intel ahead of time about how a network is laid out, so you could move horizontally in the system from your beachhead to where you want to be," he told TechNewsWorld."The bug could enable complicated attack scenarios, but this isn't as big a deal as some other big open source bugs, because a lot of hypervisors either weren't vulnerable to the bug, or the cloud providers have already removed the dead code that enables the bug," DeMott said."It isn't like a Word bug that affects every version of Word, where you can email everyone a Word document and -- boom -- you're inside a corporate network. Then you're where you want to be," he explained."Then the attacker doesn't need to be skilled to use a weapon like that," DeMott continued. "With Venom, there's a lot of ifs, ands and buts."Routers for home wireless networks have been cited by security experts for some time as a ripe target for data theft by cybercriminals, but last week they were found to be useful for another purpose: distributed denial-of-service attacks."We don't usually see routers herded together into a big botnet and used for DDoS attacks," said Tim Matthews, vice president of marketing for Incapsula, which discovered the attacks on 60 of its customers.Routers are typically vulnerable because they have easily discoverable default usernames and passwords, which many consumers tend not to change. Moreover, they have default administrator passwords that consumers don't even know about.Still, to seize a router, you need to configure it, and to do that -- even if you have a username and password -- you ordinarily need to be on the home network itself. Not so with the routers used in these DDoS attacks."These routers could be configured remotely with default credentials," Matthews told TechNewsWorld. "That meant the attackers with a script they created could automatically herd up all these routers into really big botnets."Why did the router maker enable remote configuration?"It makes customer support easier, because you always know what the administrator's password is," Matthews explained."It's about time for manufacturers to stop provisioning routers with default passwords," he said. "More importantly, they should not allow access to these routers by people who aren't on the same network."Workers are becoming more and more mobile, but many organizations appear to be challenged by the security issues created by mobility. For example, a survey of 330 IT and security professionals released last week found that 64 percent of them said a majority of their workers can access the data of their companies remotely, yet half of the respondents admitted they had inadequate or no controls in place over mobile media."If these devices aren't managed, it leaves the enterprises very vulnerable," said Marina Donovan, executive director of global marketing for Imation, which sponsored the survey conducted by the SANS Institute.Use of encryption on USB drives -- a popular way for workers to store company data they're working on -- was very low, the survey found. For companies with more than 10,000 workers it was 13 percent; for those with from 500 to 10,000 employees, 7 percent."That's crazy," Donovan told TechNewsWorld. "That's surprising, because it's readily available and easy to execute."Upcoming Security EventsJohn Mello is a freelance technology writer and contributor to Chief Security Officer magazine.
