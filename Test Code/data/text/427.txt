CONTENT:Greenwave Systems on Monday announced the expansion of its AXON Platform to unite mobile machine-to-machine and residential IoT networks into one fully manageable network service.Mobile carriers, telecommunications operators and service providers can use AXON for Mobile IoT to integrate a variety of communications protocols into the same standard IP-based language.The unified service allows telecom operators to handle billions of devices via Greenwave's implementation of Docker, the company said. They can create new revenue streams by introducing services on a managed network."Historically, an M2M service would run on two separate platforms -- the mobile platform taking care of the data subscription, and an application platform running the specific applications, such as tracking, surveillance or residential home automation. With AXON for Mobile IoT, these platforms are now combined into an all-in-one solution," said Martin Manniche, CEO of Greenwave Systems."The AXON Platform abstracts the complexity and confusion of competing IoT standards away from service and application developers, which allows rapid innovation and development cycles," Greenwave CTO Leon Hounshell told TechNewsWorld.AXON for Mobile IoT integrates into a telecom operator's existing system, letting them offer mobile IoT services without any further development on their legacy platforms, Greenwave said.The platform is built to work with major IoT standards and enables new services to run on both the mobile network and a residential network. The advantage is the ability to quickly switch services between the two to suit the specific needs of subscribers, the company said.The AXON Platform has been used to monitor home networks, IoT devices and the media activities of end users. New capabilities include location GPS, extended battery life, device tracking and telemetry.Additional features will include tracking and other sensor data for people, animals and cars; surveillance for security and monitoring; healthcare data monitoring; and smart cities applications for pollution control, parking and traffic monitoring.The platform expansion is an example of how critical mobile is to communications, for people and devices. Mobile is no longer an add-on or a separate platform. Rather, it's the core platform on which to build communications solutions and apps, noted Doug Brackbill, CEO ofLine2."Platforms offering this level of integrated mobile-first provisioning, services and apps are now the proper building blocks. They accelerate the development and availability of magical experiences that truly delight end users," he told TechNewsWorld.The AXON Platform, along with AXON for Mobile IoT, gives mobile carriers and telecommunication operators the ability to offer a broad range of IoT services, both residential and industrial, Greenwave's Hounshell said.Other solutions in the market address subsets of IoT, he added, "but with the addition of AXON for Mobile IoT, Greenwave's AXON Platform is unique in its ability to address the IoT superset, which includes industrial IoT, consumer IoT and machine-to-machine IoT across local, broadband and mobile networks in one platform."
