CONTENT:Shadow IT -- the use of unauthorized online services by company employees -- is a concern of cyberwarriors charged with defending business systems against network attacks. There's new evidence that those concerns are justified.A new attack vector on business systems leverages the synchronization features of services like Dropbox and Google Drive to perform malicious mischief, according to a report Imperva released earlier this month at the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas.The "Man in the Cloud" attack, as it's called, involves making a simple change in configuration settings to turn services into a devastating criminal tool not detected easily using common security measures, the report explains.The key to the attack is in the way the services synchronize files among devices linked to an account. Each device has software provided by the service to ensure all the information on the devices and in the cloud is the same.When a change is made in a local Dropbox folder, for example, the software ensures that the change is made in the cloud and to all other devices linked to that Dropbox account.When those changes are made, all the devices must be authenticated. Since it would be very inconvenient to authenticate all the devices by requiring the use of a user name and password every time a change is made to a file, the services use an alternative authentication method that involves the use of tokens.However, it's possible to steal a token for an account and use it to add a device to it without the account owner's knowledge, Imperva discovered. Then, every time the owner would change the information in the account, those changes would appear on the unauthorized device, too.The user does not know what's going on, and it's also hard for network defenders to detect."Communication using the cloud server doesn't raise any alarms," explained Morgan Gerhart, VP of product marketing for Imperva."If a separate communication channel were set up from a user's device to a command-and-control server somewhere, an out-of-band communication channel would be needed," he told TechNewsWorld. "That could potentially be tracked by a firewall or [intrusion detection] system."As the number of devices connected to company networks increases, the ability of traditional security solutions to counter threats will decrease, he maintained."Consumerization of IT and BYOD are accelerating the rate at which traditional endpoint and network solutions are becoming blind to the kinds of threats that are out there," Gerhart said. "Our Man-in-the-Cloud analysis is a perfect example of that." Bulletproof servers are an important part of how the online criminal underground does business, but their operations remain shadowy.The servers provide many of the same functions as legitimate hosting services, such as being repositories for any kind of content or executable code, but they cater to malicious content -- phishing sites, pornography, fake shopping and carding sites, and hacker command-and-control infrastructure.In short, it's the foundation major cybercriminal operations are built upon, according to a recent Trend Micro report."Bulletproof hosting services very consciously make a business out of providing services for illegal or unethical online behavior," said Christopher Budd, threat communications manager at Trend Micro.Why are the servers called "bulletproof"?It's all in their operator's sales pitch, which goes something like this: "If you do business with us and follow our rules, we will guarantee that we will keep your online activity up despite attempts by organizations or law enforcement to take them down," Budd  told TechNewsWorld."They can make that guarantee by being located in countries that are unresponsive or are otherwise uninterested in enforcing takedown requests," he said.What about those rules?Usually they include leaving alone the citizens in the country where the bulletproof server is located. Pornography is OK, but child pornography is usually forbidden."That's where following the rules is really important," Budd noted, "because even though bulletproof hosters are providing the material and logistical support for illegal activities, it's not anything goes."Trading on press announcements before they're released is a new twist on insider trading. Three of the biggest PR outlets on the Web earlier this month were sucked into just such a scheme involving overseas hackers and U.S. traders.The caper may be a sign that companies are thinking too small when it comes to protecting their supply chains."The modern information supply chain goes far and beyond hardware, software and logistics of an organization," said Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro."It should include not only your outside general counsel, but your PR and market intelligence firms with whom you decide to relay embargoed information," he told TechNewsWorld.Of course, organizations need to do more than just create an extensive map of their supply chain if they want to reduce the risks connected to it."As the business environment becomes more and more interconnected," BitSight VP of Business Development Jake Olcott told TechNewsWorld, "businesses will need visibility into their supply chains to make sure their vendors are doing well with cybersecurity."
