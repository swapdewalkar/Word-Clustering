CONTENT:Since mobile computing put an end to the good old days when IT departments had absolute control over software deployed in the enterprise, there's been a rise in employees' use of third-party applications -- a rise that poses security risks to corporate environments.That is one of the findings in a report CloudLock released last week.The number of third-party apps connected to corporate environments increased by 30 fold over the last two years, the firm reported, from 5,500 to 150,000 apps.CloudLock ranked more than a quarter of the apps found in business environments (27 percent) as "high risk," which means they were more likely than other apps to open pathways into an organization for cybercriminals.Companies have not ignored that danger, CloudMark's researchers also found. More than half of third-party apps were banned in many workplaces due to security-related concerns. All third-party apps pose a risk to the enterprise, but a specific subset of apps are particularly risky, according to Ayse Kaya-Firat, director of customer insights and analytics at CloudLock."The apps that touch the corporate backbone are the riskiest of all shadow applications," she told TechNewsWorld.Problems arise from the kinds of access the apps request from users, Kaya-Firat noted. "When you want to use them, some of them ask you to authorize them to use your corporate credentials. When you do that you give those apps -- and by extension their vendors -- access to your corporate network."The apps can pose a risk not only when they're being used, but also when they're not."I may enable an app's access and two years later, I may not even remember I have the app on my phone, but the app continues to have programmatic access to all my data," Kaya-Firat said.Because of the size of the challenge, organizations need to develop a high-level strategy to address the shadow app problem."They just can't go over each application one-by-one, because of the growth rate. They need specific application-use policies. They need to decide how they will whitelist or ban applications," Kaya-Firat suggested."They need to share those decisions with their end users," she added. "It can't be a secret thing, because end users are taking action on these things on a day-to-day basis."It's no secret that the information underworld often adopts techniques, processes and models from the legitimate world for criminal purposes. Such is the case with Operations Security, or Opsec.The idea behind Opsec is an old one: Deny your adversaries information they can use to harm you. For hackers, that means denying authorities intelligence that can lead to detection of their activities, dismantling of their attack infrastructure, and exposure of their compromised environments.Cybercriminals exercise Opsec in a number of ways, noted Rick Holland, vice president of strategy at Digital Shadows.For example, they create "legends" about themselves -- that is, false identities to prevent law enforcement or even other hackers from tracking them."The ones that have mature Opsec will not use anything that ties their personal life to the legend they've created," Holland told TechNewsWorld.They'll also try to mask the identity of the workstations they use."They'll use specialized operating systems designed to preserve anonymity," Holland explained.They'll try to obfuscate network connections, too."They'll do their evil from public hotspots and spoof their MAC address so they can't be traced from the logs for the hotspot," Holland said.As some of the means for maintaining Opsec become more vulnerable to compromise -- as has happened with Tor and bitcoin -- hackers will need to adopt another legitimate technique to preserve their security."Cybercriminals will need to adopt a 'defense in depth' strategy," said Holland. "It's something they'll need to do across their spectrum of people, process and technology."Ransomware not only has attracted many practitioners in the information underworld, but also has changed long-held expectations about garnering profit from online scams."Ransomware has changed the entire model of how these criminal enterprises make money," said Ed Cabrera, vice president of cybersecurity strategy at Trend Micro."If you look at the criminal handbook on how to make money, the first chapter is targeting, the second chapter is the attack -- but there's multiple chapters on how to monetize the data that is stolen," he told TechNewsWorld."It usually takes weeks or months to monetize that data," Cabrera continued. "Ransomware is like direct sales. They go after a victim, and they can monetize in days."

'Even though law enforcement over the years has been able to take down other anonymous payment systems, WebMoney is a more difficult proposition because it's hosted in Russia.'"In fact, WebMoney has a multi-level authentication system, spokesperson Tania Milacheva told TechNewsWorld. "According to the rules of WebMoney Transfer, each system participant should have a WM-Passport. The user can fully use the system services, only after his/her personal data was checked, verified and he/she has received a higher level of WebMoney Passport."Further, its head office is located in Cambridge, UK. "The FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) license granted to WebMoney Europe Ltd. has secured the company's status as an e-money issuer in all countries within the European Economic Area," Milacheva said.Trend Micro subsequently acknowledged Cabrera's errors in a statement provided to TechNewsWorld by spokesperson Jerrod Resweber.
