CONTENT:Imagine a world where playing Pong and Minecraft gives people the power to program their computers. That world is Kano.A crowdfunded startup, it took the idea behind Lego to teach computer programming by playing first-generation computer games. Kano launched on Kickstarter in November 2013. More than 13,000 people from some 50 countries raised US$1.5 million in 30 days. Barely one year later, Kano is getting ready to deliver 18,000 preordered kits purchased for $129 each.The idea behind Kano Blocks, a collection of Lego-like shapes with embedded programming code, came from the then 6-year-old son of cofounder Saul Klein. Two other cofounders, Yonatan Raz-Fridman and Alex Klein, head the team of software developers at the company's headquarters in London.The innovative programming language lets kids drag and drop blocks into the code window to create Python or JavaScript code. The Kano Kit is powered by the Debian Linux derivative distro and a suite of apps.The Kano Kit comes with a Raspberry Pi, a custom case, covers, a wireless keyboard with trackpad, HDMI and MicroUSB cables for display and power, a USB WiFi dongle, power sockets, and an 8-GB SD card carrying the Kano OS.In this exclusive interview, Alejandro Simon, Kano's head of software and leader of the Kano OS, discusses the process of letting anyone discover the power of computer programming without actually teaching them how to write code.Alejandro Simon, Kano's Head of Softwareand Leader of the Kano OSLinuxInsider: Why do we need a new approach to teaching computer programming?Alejandro Simon:
