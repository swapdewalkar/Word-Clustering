CONTENT:When small businesses choose an IT and support service provider, the two most important considerations are the provider's ability to include all of the company's devices and provide a comprehensive IT service plan.More than half of small businesses that use professional IT services use two or more services. However, small businesses may have to rely on multiple vendors to address their IT needs, resulting in a highly fragmented IT and support services market.Broadband service providers have been successful in providing services across multiple categories. They have achieved at least 13 percent market share across various IT services, a testament to the increased focus of many broadband providers to bundle IT services with broadband for small businesses.Local IT companies are also strong players across service categories.The preference among small businesses for familiar providers and service bundles gives strong competitive advantage to incumbent IT service providers. Broadband providers have an advantage over other vendor options as a result of their existing relationship with SMB clients; more than 50 percent of SMBs in most industries subscribe to broadband services.As telcos and cable companies that provide broadband services to small businesses assess opportunities to generate additional revenue, services that leverage the operator's strengths in network and in data-oriented services are a natural addition.Over the past few years, most of the larger providers in the U.S. have embarked on designing IT and support service packages that appeal to SMBs.The scope of service offerings differs among broadband providers; however, most providers offer some or all the following services:Service providers also market their offerings under several strategic objectives that are relevant to small businesses, including the following:Promoting outcomes or business objectives allows service providers to appeal to small-business decision-makers who may have limited technical knowledge upon which to base a purchase decision.At the same time, such broad messages provide little differentiation from other vendors. That may prove problematic in a highly fragmented market.In addition to listing the actual products and services on their websites, service providers may also provide a number of other resources for small businesses:The market for providing IT and support services to SMBs is huge for broadband providers and others that provide bundled services specific to the needs of individual companies.Total revenues for IT and support services for U.S. small businesses -- including cloud storage, server management, cloud-based productivity applications, network security, technical support and cloud-based enterprise applications revenues -- are estimated to increase from US$8.4 billion in 2015 to approximately $10.1 billion in 2019.Patrice Samuels is a research analyst at Parks Associates.
